This project defines classes for sending simple messages over sockets.

The entry points for using this project are the following classes:

	SocketComms					handles all communications with a socket, either client or server.
	XMLSocketServer				encapsulates a socket server for accepting XML messages.
								Contains a SocketComms object.
	LwIXMLSocketServerListener	interface to implement to receive call-backs from an XMLSocketServer instance.
	
The SocketComms class works standalone as the client side.
The XMLSocketServer acts as the complimenting server side.

See the TestSimpleSocketServer.java JUnit test case for an example of creating client and server instances.
See ExampleSocketServer for an example of using LwIXMLSocketServerListener interface.

See the GeMHa project for example use of these classes, especially AcceptMessagesFromSocket.java and
ProcessMessageForSocket.java.
